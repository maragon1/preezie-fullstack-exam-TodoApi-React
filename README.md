# TodoAPI - React

Live demo: [TodoAPI React]([https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app](https://mark-aragon-preezie-react-463d1d033a64.herokuapp.com/)).

This allows user to add task, toggle and delete.

##Challenges

Here, I modified the code by adding or updating the following:

- Error handling
- Separation of api.js from the app.js to have clean visibility
- I also made the every handling updating only the state instead of timely fetching all the records from the API
